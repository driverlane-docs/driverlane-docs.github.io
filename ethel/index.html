<p>Ethel is focused on moving or updating data in content management solutions, like file systems, SharePoint, Content
  Server, Documentum, etc.
</p>

<p>Ethel uses small task runners to provide reuseable components to perform the various parts of the updates. Task
  runners are organised in a job. The job details the order of the task runners and their configuration. Each task
  runner handles a discrete part of the job definition, such as traversing a file system, uploading a file to a target
  system, or adding metadata to the task definition that is needed to upload a file successfully.</p>

<p>Task runners are separated into three types:
<ul>
  <li><i>extractors</i> - parse a data source and create tasks to be processed by transfomers and loaders. They may do
    actions like copying the source document to a staging location, but they should not change either the source or
    target systems.</li>
  <li><i>transformers</i> - update the data in the task to allow the uploader to complete it's work. It's expected
    that transformers will often be job specific components. These exist to allow extractors and loaders to be
    relatively static, reuseable components.</li>
  <li><i>loaders</i> - take the information in the task and create or update an object in a target system.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>A relatively simple job definition is:
<pre><code>{
  "name": "Employee files production",
  "runners": {
    "extract": [
      {
        "type": "FileSystemExtractor",
        "config": {
          "extractLocation": "E:\\Staging",
          "hashName": "prod-employees"
        },
        "id": "1UaunhL2qFdPDtexwg7Eo"
      }
    ],
    "load": [
      {
        "type": "EmployeeTransformer",
        "id": "rq4c5UOVwsYxQiU5owJCi"
      },
      {
        "type": "CloudLoader",
        "config": {
          "hashName": "prod-employees",
          "connection": {
            "name": "prod-employees",
            "key": "connection"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "id": "Bveo3Lge8-Fg_-UZb9LV4"
}</code></pre>
</p>

<p>In this example, files in the staging directory are scanned and a task created for each file using the
  FileSystemExtractor task runner. The EmployeeTransformer task runner then processes each file, adding employee
  information to the data captured previously. Then the CloudLoader task runner uses the data captured by the previous
  runners and the connection details in the configuration to connect to the cloud solution and upload the file.</p>

<p>An instance of a job is called a run. A run is one pass of the job defintion. It contains the outcomes for each task
  created by the extractor. Depending on the functionality of the task runners used, runs can be repeated to retry
  failed updates or discover new files or updates.</p>
